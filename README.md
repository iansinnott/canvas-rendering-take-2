# Canvas Rendering

How does HTML Canvas work? I'm going to find out

## Commands

* `yarn start`: Start the dev server with hot reloading
* `yarn build`: Build the app. See NOTE below

**NOTE:** The build is currently only for development. There is no distinction between prod and dev yet. Just one `webpack.config.js`. Just something to be aware of.
