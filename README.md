# Canvas Rendering Take 2

I'm exploring canvas rendering and it turns out games are a great way to learn about canvas. I built this game based on this excellent tutorial: http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/

## Dev

* `yarn start`: Start the dev server with hot reloading
* `yarn build`: Build the app. See NOTE below

**NOTE:** The build is currently only for development. There is no distinction between prod and dev yet. Just one `webpack.config.js`. Just something to be aware of.
